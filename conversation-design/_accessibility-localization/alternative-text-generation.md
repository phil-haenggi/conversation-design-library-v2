```

=== DECISION FLOWCHART ===

**Step 1**: Is the image purely decorative?
- YES → Use alt=""
- NO → Continue to Step 2

**Step 2**: Does the image contain text?
- YES → Include all text + describe visual presentation
- NO → Continue to Step 3

**Step 3**: Is the image functional (button, link, control)?
- YES → Describe action/destination, not appearance
- NO → Continue to Step 4

**Step 4**: Is the image simple (single object, person, scene)?
- YES → Concise description (< 125 chars)
- NO → Continue to Step 5

**Step 5**: Is the image complex (chart, diagram, infographic)?
- YES → Brief alt + long description via aria-describedby or adjacent text
- NO → Standard informative alt text

=== EXAMPLES ===

**Example 1: E-commerce Product Photo**
- image_type: "photograph"
- image_purpose: "informative, shows product details"
- context_location: "product listing page"
- surrounding_content: "product name, price, description already visible"
- user_action: "click to view larger image or product details"
- complexity_level: "simple"

**Output**:
```yaml
image_assessment:
  image_type: "photograph"
  purpose_classification: "informative"
  context_description: "Product image in listing grid with visible product name and price"

alternative_text:
  short_alt:
    text: "Red leather crossbody bag with gold chain strap"
    character_count: 52
    rationale: "Product name visible nearby, alt describes distinguishing visual features"

  aria_label:
    needed: false

  aria_describedby:
    needed: false

decorative_designation:
  is_decorative: false
  justification: "Provides essential product information not in surrounding text"

testing_validation:
  screen_reader_test:
    announcement_preview: "Luna Leather Bag, $89, Red leather crossbody bag with gold chain strap, button"
    natural_flow: true
```

**Example 2: Data Visualization - Sales Chart**
- image_type: "chart"
- image_purpose: "informative, shows quarterly sales trend"
- context_location: "annual report section"
- surrounding_content: "heading 'Q1-Q4 Sales Performance', analysis paragraph below"
- complexity_level: "complex"

**Output**:
```yaml
image_assessment:
  image_type: "chart"
  purpose_classification: "complex"
  context_description: "Line chart showing sales data in report context"

alternative_text:
  short_alt:
    text: "Line chart: Sales increased 34% from Q1 to Q4 2024, from $2.1M to $2.8M"
    character_count: 77
    rationale: "Captures essential trend and magnitude, details in linked table"

  aria_describedby:
    needed: true
    linked_text_id: "sales-data-table"
    content: "See sales data table below for complete quarterly breakdown"

complex_images:
  summary_alt:
    text: "Line chart: Sales increased 34% from Q1 to Q4 2024"
    character_count: 54

  long_description:
    method: "aria-describedby linking to data table"
    data_table: |
      <table>
        <caption>Quarterly Sales Performance 2024</caption>
        <tr><th>Quarter</th><th>Sales</th><th>Growth</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Q1</td><td>$2.1M</td><td>—</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Q2</td><td>$2.3M</td><td>+9.5%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Q3</td><td>$2.6M</td><td>+13%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Q4</td><td>$2.8M</td><td>+7.7%</td></tr>
      </table>
```

**Example 3: Decorative Icon Pattern**
- image_type: "icon"
- image_purpose: "decorative visual accent"
- context_location: "section heading decoration"
- surrounding_content: "heading text provides all semantic meaning"
- complexity_level: "simple"

**Output**:
```yaml
image_assessment:
  image_type: "icon"
  purpose_classification: "decorative"
  context_description: "Small checkmark icon next to 'Benefits' heading, purely visual accent"

alternative_text:
  short_alt:
    text: ""
    character_count: 0
    rationale: "Decorative only, heading provides all meaning, alt text would be redundant noise"

decorative_designation:
  is_decorative: true
  justification: "Icon adds no information beyond visible heading text"
  implementation: "alt='' or role='presentation'"
```

**Accessibility Requirements**: Must comply with WCAG 3.0 Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content) Level A. Follow W3C Alt Text Decision Tree and DIAGRAM Center guidelines for complex images. Ensure alt text is concise yet complete, context-appropriate, and never redundant with visible text. Provide long descriptions for complex images via aria-describedby, longdesc, or adjacent text. Use alt="" for decorative images. Test with actual screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack).

**Psychological Principles**: Information equivalence ensures cognitive parity (cognitive load theory). Context-appropriate detail reduces uncertainty (information theory). Concise descriptions respect working memory limits (Miller's Law). Functional alt text supports goal completion (goal-setting theory). Consistent patterns build predictability (schema theory).

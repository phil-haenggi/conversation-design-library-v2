    - visual_text: "string"
      accessible_name: "complete action description"
      aria_label: "if needed for clarification"
      context_needed: "boolean"
      example_announcement: "what screen reader says"

  links:
    - link_text: "descriptive, out-of-context meaningful"
      avoid: "click here, read more, learn more"
      context_provision: "how surrounding context helps"
      aria_label_override: "only when visual insufficient"

```

=== ANNOUNCEMENT PATTERNS ===

**Context-First Announcements**:
- Pattern: "{{context}} {{action}} {{state}}"
- Example: "Shopping cart, Remove item button, 3 items remaining"

**State Changes**:
- Before: "{{previous_state}}"
- After: "{{new_state}}, {{result}}"
- Confirmation: "{{action_completed}}"

**Error Recovery**:
- Immediate: "{{error_type}}, {{field_name}}, {{correction_guidance}}"
- Navigation: "{{error_count}} errors, jump to first error link"

=== VERBOSITY OPTIMIZATION ===

Design for multiple verbosity levels:

**Low Verbosity** (experienced users):
- Concise labels
- Minimal redundancy
- Assume ARIA role knowledge

**Medium Verbosity** (default):
- Complete context
- Action + result
- Clear state announcements

**High Verbosity** (novice users):
- Full descriptions
- Instructional hints
- Detailed navigation guidance

**Accessibility Requirements**: Must comply with WCAG 3.0 Level AA (ideally AAA). Follow ARIA Authoring Practices Guide 1.2 for widget patterns. Ensure all content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust per POUR principles. Test with actual screen reader users across platforms. Provide text alternatives for all non-text content. Ensure logical reading order and focus management.

**Psychological Principles**: Reduced cognitive load through predictable patterns (consistency principle). Clear mental models through semantic structure (schema theory). Confidence building through informative feedback (self-efficacy). Reduced anxiety through proactive guidance (uncertainty reduction theory). Empowerment through comprehensive keyboard access (autonomy principle).

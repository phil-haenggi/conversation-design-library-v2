Generate idiomatic expression analysis and adaptation:

```yaml
expression_categories:
  idioms:
    definition: "Phrases whose meaning cannot be deduced from individual words"
    challenge: "Often culture-specific, don't translate literally"
    examples:

      regional:

    when_appropriate: "Expression exists similarly in target language"
    example:
      source: "Time is money (English)"
      spanish: "El tiempo es oro (Time is gold)"
      adaptation: "Slight variation but conveys same concept"

    risks:
      - "May sound awkward if not natural in target language"
      - "May lose intended impact"

  functional_equivalent:
    when_appropriate: "Target culture has similar idiom with same meaning"
    examples:
      source_english: "It's raining cats and dogs"
      french_equivalent: "Il pleut des cordes (It's raining ropes)"
      spanish_equivalent: "Llueve a cántaros (It's raining pitchers)"

        plain: "You're exactly right"

  transcreation:
    when_appropriate: "Creative recreation for equivalent emotional impact"
    requires: "Copywriting skill, cultural expertise"
    examples:

      spanish: "¿Y tú? ¿Ya tomaste leche?"
      analysis: "Complete recreation maintains impact, not literal translation"

  cultural_substitution:
    when_appropriate: "Replace culture-specific reference with target equivalent"
    examples:
      - source: "Black Friday shopping deals"
        china: "Singles' Day (11/11) shopping deals"
        europe: "Summer sales / Winter sales"

  risk_assessment:
    low_risk:
      characteristics: "Universal concepts, clear context, non-critical"

**Adaptation Rationale**:
- Removed generational slang ("fire") → clearer language
- Used functional Spanish equivalents where they exist
- Plain language for complex idioms without good equivalents
- Maintained energetic tone through word choice and punctuation
- Kept emoji (universally understood)

**Example 2: Software UI Error Message - English to Japanese**
- content_type: "error messages and help text"
- source_culture: "United States (tech industry, casual)"
- target_culture: "Japan"
- tone: "Source is casual/friendly, target should be polite/professional"

**Source English (with idioms)**:
```
Error Messages:
1. "Oops! Looks like we dropped the ball on that one."
2. "This feature is still in the oven. Check back soon!"
3. "Houston, we have a problem. Try again later."
4. "Looks like you're barking up the wrong tree. That file doesn't exist."
```

**Analysis and Adaptation**:
```yaml
message_1:
  source: "Oops! Looks like we dropped the ball on that one."
  idiom: "Dropped the ball (made a mistake)"
  cultural_ref: "Sports metaphor (American football/baseball)"
  tone_issue: "'Oops' very casual, may seem unprofessional in Japanese"

  japanese_adaptation:
    avoid: "ボールを落としました (literal: dropped the ball - confusing)"
    use: "申し訳ございません。エラーが発生しました。"
    translation: "We apologize. An error has occurred."
    rationale: "Polite, clear, professional tone appropriate for Japanese UI"

message_2:
  source: "This feature is still in the oven. Check back soon!"
  idiom: "In the oven (still being developed, like baking)"
  cultural_adaptation:
    avoid: "オーブンの中 (literal: in the oven - nonsensical)"
    use: "この機能は現在開発中です。もうしばらくお待ちください。"
    translation: "This feature is currently under development. Please wait a little longer."
    rationale: "Clear, respectful, no confusing metaphor"

message_3:
  source: "Houston, we have a problem. Try again later."
  cultural_ref: "Apollo 13 movie/historical event (US-specific)"
  recognition: "Well-known phrase globally, but may not resonate in Japan"

  japanese_adaptation:
    avoid: "ヒューストン、問題が発生しました (keeps reference, confusing)"
    use: "問題が発生しました。しばらくしてからもう一度お試しください。"
    translation: "A problem has occurred. Please try again later."
    rationale: "Removes cultural reference, maintains clarity"

message_4:
  source: "Looks like you're barking up the wrong tree. That file doesn't exist."
  idiom: "Barking up the wrong tree (pursuing wrong path)"
  origin: "Hunting dogs barking at wrong tree"

  japanese_adaptation:
    avoid: "間違った木に吠えています (literal: barking at wrong tree)"
    use: "そのファイルは存在しません。ファイル名をご確認ください。"
    translation: "That file does not exist. Please check the filename."
    rationale: "Direct, helpful, no confusing idiom"
```

**Improved Source English (Idiom-Free)**:
```
Error Messages:
1. "An error occurred. Please try again."
2. "This feature is coming soon. Check back later!"
3. "Unable to complete action. Please try again later."
4. "File not found. Please check the filename and try again."
```

**Rationale for Source Improvement**:
- Clearer even for native English speakers
- Easier to translate accurately
- More professional and helpful
- Reduces localization costs
- Better for non-native English speakers using English version

**Example 3: Blog Post - Idiom Replacement Guide**
- content_type: "educational blog about productivity"
- target_audience: "global, non-native English speakers"
- goal: "accessible to international readers"

**Before (Heavy Idiomatic Usage)**:
```
"Want to be productive? Here's the lowdown: First, tackle the low-hanging fruit. Don't bite off more than you can chew. When you hit a wall, don't throw in the towel – think outside the box! Keep your eye on the prize and you'll be ahead of the curve in no time. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, so don't put all your eggs in one basket. At the end of the day, if you play your cards right, you'll be sitting pretty!"
```

**After (Plain Language, Globally Accessible)**:
```
"Want to be productive? Here's what you need to know: First, start with the easiest tasks. Don't take on more work than you can handle. When you face a challenge, don't give up – try a creative solution! Stay focused on your goals and you'll make faster progress than others. Remember, big achievements take time, so work on multiple projects. Ultimately, if you make good decisions, you'll achieve success!"
```

**Idiom Replacement Table**:
```yaml
replacements:
  - idiom: "Here's the lowdown"
    plain: "Here's what you need to know"

  - idiom: "Low-hanging fruit"
    plain: "The easiest tasks"

**Accessibility Requirements**: Idiomatic expressions can create barriers for users with cognitive disabilities, non-native speakers, and screen reader users. Follow WCAG 3.0 Success Criterion 3.1.3 (Unusual Words) Level AAA - provide definitions for idioms and unusual words. Prefer plain language that is universally understandable. When idioms must be used, provide context clues. Test content with non-native speakers and users with cognitive disabilities to ensure comprehension.

**Psychological Principles**: Linguistic relativity affects how expressions are perceived (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis). Familiar language increases processing fluency (fluency effect). Unfamiliar idioms increase cognitive load (cognitive load theory). Plain language improves comprehension for all users (universal design). Cultural schema affects interpretation (schema theory). In-group language builds connection but excludes others (in-group/out-group dynamics).

    - "Overuse reduces clarity"

  statistics:
    unicode_version: "15.1 (as of 2023)"
    total_emojis: "3,600+ emojis"
    common_usage: "~100 emojis account for 90% of usage"

when_to_use_emojis:

    casual_communication:
      - "Chat messages, team collaboration tools"

    professional_critical:
      - "Legal documents"
      - "Medical instructions"
      - "Financial transactions"
      - "Error messages with serious consequences"
      - "Security warnings"

    accessibility_first:
      - "Essential navigation (provide text alternative)"
      - "Critical information conveyance"
      - "Form labels (never emoji alone)"

    formal_communication:
      - "Business proposals"
      - "Official announcements"
      - "Academic writing"
      - "Government communications"

accessibility_guidelines:
  screen_reader_considerations:
    problem: "Screen readers announce emoji descriptions"
    examples:
      - "🎉 → 'party popper'"
      - "❤️ → 'red heart'"
      - "👍 → 'thumbs up'"
      - "😊 → 'smiling face with smiling eyes'"

    issues:
      verbose: "Multiple emojis create long announcements"
      interrupts_flow: "Breaks natural reading rhythm"
      unclear_intent: "User may not understand why emoji is there"

  best_practices:
    redundancy_principle:
      rule: "Emoji should supplement text, never replace it"
      good: "✅ Task complete"
      bad: "✅" (emoji alone, unclear meaning)

    decorative_vs_meaningful:
      decorative:
        use: "aria-hidden='true' or as CSS background"
        example: "Celebration 🎉 (emoji adds flair, text has meaning)"

      meaningful:
        use: "Include in semantic content"
        alt_text: "Not standard for emoji, ensure text context"

    placement:
      after_text: "Success! ✅ (easier to read)"
      not_before: "✅ Success (screen reader announces emoji first)"

    limit_quantity:
      rule: "Maximum 1-2 emojis per message/line"
      reason: "Reduces screen reader verbosity"

  aria_label_approach:
    when_emoji_critical:
      html: "<span aria-label='Success'>✅</span>"
      effect: "Screen reader says 'Success' instead of 'white heavy check mark'"

    when_emoji_decorative:
      html: "<span aria-hidden='true'>🎉</span> Celebration!"
      effect: "Screen reader skips emoji, reads 'Celebration!'"

platform_consistency:
  rendering_differences:
    problem: "Same emoji looks different on iOS, Android, Windows, web"

    examples:
      gun_emoji:
        ios_15_plus: "🔫 Water pistol (toy)"
        older_android: "🔫 Real handgun"
        meaning_shift: "Apple changed to toy gun, others followed"

      smile_emoji:
        unicode: "😊 Smiling face with smiling eyes"

**Accessibility Requirements**: Emoji usage must not create barriers for screen reader users, users with cognitive disabilities, or users on platforms with poor emoji support. Follow WCAG 3.0 Level AA guidelines. Use `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative emoji. Always provide text alternatives for meaningful emoji. Never use emoji as sole conveyers of critical information. Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack, JAWS, NVDA) to ensure announcements are natural. Consider users who may not understand emoji meanings or cultural contexts. Provide fallbacks for platforms that don't support emoji.

**Psychological Principles**: Visual elements draw attention (attention theory). Emotional cues influence perception (affect heuristic). Familiar symbols reduce processing time (processing fluency). Overuse creates fatigue (diminishing returns). Cultural context shapes interpretation (schema theory). Consistency builds trust (consistency principle). Personality in communication increases engagement (social presence theory).

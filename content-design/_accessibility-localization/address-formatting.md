form_design_strategies:
  dynamic_country_based:
    principle: "Adapt form fields based on selected country"

    implementation:
      1: "Country selector at top of form"
      2: "Form fields update based on country"
      3: "Field labels change to local terms"
      4: "Required/optional fields adjust"

    example:
      us_selected:
        shows: ["Street Address", "Apt/Suite", "City", "State", "ZIP Code"]
        labels: "State, ZIP Code"
        validation: "5 or 9-digit ZIP"

        shows: ["Postal Code", "Prefecture", "City", "Street", "Building"]
        order: "Postal code first"
        validation: "7-digit postal code"

  universal_flexible_form:
    principle: "Generic form that works for all countries"

    fields:
      - field: "Address Line 1"
        required: true
        help: "Street address, P.O. box, company name"

    cons:
      - "Not optimized for any specific country"
      - "May confuse users (extra fields they don't need)"
      - "Harder to validate"

  smart_freeform:
    principle: "Single text area with smart parsing"

    implementation:
      - "Large text area for full address"
      - "AI/ML parsing to extract components"
      - "Fallback to manual field entry if parsing fails"

    example:
      input: |
        123 Main Street
        Apt 4B
        New York, NY 10001
        United States

      parsed:
        street: "123 Main Street"
        unit: "Apt 4B"
        city: "New York"
        state: "NY"
        zip: "10001"
        country: "United States"

    use_case: "Quick checkout, mobile forms, address copying"

address_autocomplete:
  google_places_api:
    benefits:
      - "Comprehensive global coverage"
      - "Real-time validation"
      - "Auto-fills components"

    implementation:
      - "Type-ahead suggestions"
      - "Fill address on selection"
      - "Parse into form fields"

    considerations:
      - "Cost (API charges)"
      - "Privacy (sends data to Google)"
      - "Requires internet connection"

  local_postal_apis:
    us: "USPS Address Validation"
    uk: "Royal Mail Postcode Finder"
    canada: "Canada Post AddressComplete"

    benefit: "Authoritative data for specific country"

  manual_entry:
    always_allow: "Autocomplete is helper, not requirement"
    use_case:
      - "New buildings/streets not in database"
      - "Privacy-conscious users"
      - "Offline scenarios"

validation_strategies:
  lenient_validation:
    principle: "Accept addresses as users enter them"
    validate: "Format warnings, not errors"
    example: "ZIP code format unusual, but accepting"
    use_when: "User knows their address better than system"

  strict_validation:
    principle: "Verify address with postal service"
    reject: "Invalid or undeliverable addresses"
    use_when: "Shipping critical, reduce failed deliveries"

  progressive_validation:
    principle: "Validate as user types, suggest corrections"
    example:
      user_types: "10001-"
      suggestion: "Did you mean 10001-1234? (ZIP+4)"

display_formatting:
  storage_vs_display:
    storage:
      format: "Structured components in database"
      fields: "street, city, state, postal_code, country (separate)"

    display:
      format: "Formatted according to local conventions"
      us: "City, State ZIP"
      uk: "Town, Postcode"
      germany: "PLZ Stadt"

  international_orders:
    destination_format:
      principle: "Format address for destination country"
      example: "UK address formatted UK-style, even if sender is US"

    labels:
      include: "Shipping label formatted per destination postal service"

special_cases:
  military_addresses:
    us_apo_fpo:
      format: |
        [Name]
        [Unit]
        [APO/FPO] [AA/AE/AP] [ZIP]

      example: "APO AE 09001"
      note: "Treated as domestic US for shipping purposes"

  po_boxes:
    many_countries: "P.O. Box common, must support"
    format: "P.O. Box 12345"
    cannot_ship: "Some couriers don't deliver to P.O. Boxes"
    separate_field: "Optional separate field or part of address line 1"

  rural_routes:
    format: "RR 1, Box 123"
    countries: "Canada, US rural areas"

  non_standard_addresses:
    examples:
      - "Islands: no street names, only house names"
      - "Rural areas: landmarks instead of addresses"
      - "Developing regions: informal addressing"

    approach:
      - "Flexible text fields"
      - "Don't enforce strict structure"
      - "Allow descriptive addresses"

localization_considerations:
  field_labels:
    translate: "Use local terminology"
    examples:
      us: "ZIP Code"
      uk: "Postcode"
      germany: "Postleitzahl"
      france: "Code postal"

  field_order:
    adapt: "Order fields per local convention"
    western: "Name → Street → City → State → Postal → Country"
    asian: "Postal → Region → City → Street → Building → Name"

  placeholder_examples:
    show_local: "Use local example addresses in placeholders"
    us: "e.g., 10001"
    uk: "e.g., SW1A 1AA"
    canada: "e.g., K1A 0B1"

  error_messages:
    localized: "Error messages in user's language"

**Accessibility Requirements**: Address forms must comply with WCAG 3.0 Level AA. Use proper HTML5 input types (address-line1, postal-code, etc.) for autocomplete support. Ensure all fields have associated labels (never use placeholder as sole label). Provide clear error messages with correction guidance. Support keyboard navigation through all fields. Ensure country dropdown is searchable for screen reader users. Test with international screen readers. Support right-to-left text for RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew). Provide adequate touch targets (44x44px minimum) for mobile forms.

**Psychological Principles**: Familiar local formats reduce cognitive load (processing fluency). Clear examples guide users (anchoring effect). Progressive disclosure reduces overwhelm (information foraging). Smart defaults save time (default effect). Flexible input respects user knowledge (autonomy). Validation feedback prevents errors (error prevention). Localized terminology builds trust (cultural schema congruence).

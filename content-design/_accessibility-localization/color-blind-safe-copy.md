Generate color-blind accessible content strategy:

```yaml
color_vision_deficiency_types:
  protanopia:
    description: "Red-blind - difficulty distinguishing red from green"
    affected_colors: ["red", "orange", "green"]
    percentage: "1% of males, 0.01% of females"

  deuteranopia:
    description: "Green-blind - difficulty distinguishing red from green"
    affected_colors: ["red", "green", "brown", "orange"]
    percentage: "1% of males, most common type"

  tritanopia:
    description: "Blue-blind - difficulty distinguishing blue from yellow"
    affected_colors: ["blue", "green", "yellow"]
    percentage: "0.001% of population, very rare"

  achromatopsia:
    description: "Complete color blindness - see only grayscale"
    affected_colors: ["all colors"]
    percentage: "0.003% of population"

redundancy_principle:
  never_color_alone:
    wcag_criterion: "1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)"
    requirement: "Color is not the only visual means of conveying information"

    redundant_encoding_methods:
      - text_labels: "Explicit text stating status/category/value"
      - icons: "Distinct icons for different states"
      - patterns: "Stripes, dots, hatching for chart areas"
      - shapes: "Different shapes for different data series"
      - position: "Spatial organization conveys meaning"
      - typography: "Bold, italic, underline, size"
      - borders: "Different border styles or weights"

content_patterns:
  status_indicators:
    bad_practice:
      visual: "Colored dot only (🔴 🟢 🟡)"
      problem: "Color-blind users cannot distinguish"

    good_practice:
      visual_text: "Text label + icon + color"
      examples:
        - status: "Active"
          visual: "✓ Active (green)"
          html: "<span class='status-active'><svg>checkmark</svg> Active</span>"

          visual: "⏱ Pending (yellow)"
          html: "<span class='status-pending'><svg>clock</svg> Pending</span>"

        - status: "Error"
          visual: "⚠ Error (red)"
          html: "<span class='status-error'><svg>warning</svg> Error</span>"

  form_validation:
    bad_practice:
      visual: "Red border on invalid field"
      problem: "Red border may not be visible to color-blind users"

    good_practice:
      multiple_indicators:
        - border: "Thicker border or different style"
        - icon: "X or warning icon next to field"
        - text: "Error message below field"
        - aria: "aria-invalid='true' and aria-describedby"

      example_error_field:
        visual: "Thick border + ⚠️ icon + error text"
        text: "⚠️ Email address is required"
        html: "<input aria-invalid='true' aria-describedby='email-error'><span id='email-error'>⚠️ Email address is required</span>"

  links_and_interactive_elements:
    bad_practice:
      visual: "Blue underlined text (color only signals clickability)"
      problem: "Underline helps, but color alone shouldn't indicate state"

    good_practice:
      default_link: "Underline + color + distinct font weight"
      hover_state: "Bold + underline + background highlight"
      visited_link: "Different underline style (dotted) + color"
      focus_state: "Strong outline + background color"

**Accessibility Requirements**: Must comply with WCAG 3.0 Success Criterion 1.4.1 (Use of Color) Level A and 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast) Level AA. Never use color as the only visual means of conveying information. Ensure 3:1 contrast ratio for UI components and graphical objects. Provide text alternatives, icons, patterns, shapes, or position to supplement color coding. Test with color-blind simulation tools (ColorOracle, Coblis). Validate with users who have color vision deficiencies across protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia.

**Psychological Principles**: Redundant coding improves information processing (dual coding theory). Multiple sensory channels increase accessibility (modality effect). Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load (schema theory). Clear distinctions support rapid recognition (feature integration theory). Inclusive design benefits all users (universal design principle).
